# web-based-form
This is a small project that I used to learn form validation and submitting to the server.
In this project, I created a registration page and a login page, where user credentials from the registration page are validated on the client side using javascript and then passed the database with php. 
During login, user's credentials are counter-checked to match with the ones in the databse before the user is able to login. 
There is also a search field to see if a particular user is in the system and who is not.
